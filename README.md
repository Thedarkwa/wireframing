Wireframing
Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide or blueprint that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application. It outlines the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a page or screen — without focusing on design elements like colors, images, or typography.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the placement of key interface elements, navigation flow, and user interactions before actual development begins.

Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial step in the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design process. It serves as the foundation for building intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Here are some key reasons why wireframing is important:

Clarifies Design Concepts
Wireframes make it easier to communicate ideas visually and align everyone on the project’s vision early in the process.

Saves Time and Cost
Identifying usability issues and layout problems during the wireframing stage prevents costly changes later in development.

Improves User Experience
Wireframes allow designers to plan user journeys and ensure that navigation is logical and efficient.

Facilitates Collaboration
They act as a common reference point between designers, developers, and stakeholders, promoting better teamwork and feedback.
